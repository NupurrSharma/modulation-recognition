# ðŸ“¡ Modulation Recognition with Explainable AI

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for **wireless signal modulation classification** using both **synthetic** and **RadioML** datasets.  
It also integrates **Grad-CAM** for explainability and a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive exploration.
